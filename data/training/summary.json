    "input": "Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants and some other organisms use sunlight to synthesize foods with the help of chlorophyll. During photosynthesis, plants take in carbon dioxide (CO2) from the air and water (H2O) from the soil. Using the energy from sunlight, they convert these into glucose (C6H12O6) and oxygen (O2). The glucose is used by the plant for energy and growth, while the oxygen is released into the atmosphere. This process occurs primarily in the leaves of plants, specifically in organelles called chloroplasts. Photosynthesis can be divided into two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle). The light-dependent reactions occur in the thylakoid membranes and produce ATP and NADPH. The Calvin cycle occurs in the stroma and uses ATP and NADPH to convert CO2 into glucose.",

    "input": "The water cycle, also known as the hydrologic cycle, describes the continuous movement of water on, above, and below the surface of the Earth. The cycle begins with evaporation, where water from oceans, lakes, and rivers is heated by the sun and turns into water vapor. This water vapor rises into the atmosphere where it cools and condenses to form clouds through a process called condensation. When the water droplets in clouds become too heavy, they fall back to Earth as precipitation in the form of rain, snow, sleet, or hail. Some of this precipitation flows over the land as surface runoff, eventually returning to bodies of water. Some water infiltrates into the ground, becoming groundwater, which can be stored in aquifers or slowly flow back to the surface through springs. Plants also play a role through transpiration, releasing water vapor from their leaves. The entire cycle is powered by solar energy and gravity.",
    "output": "The water cycle is the continuous movement of water through evaporation (water turning to vapor), condensation (vapor forming clouds), precipitation (rain/snow falling), and collection (water returning to bodies of water or infiltrating ground). The cycle is driven by solar energy and gravity, with plants contributing through transpiration."

    "input": "Newton's First Law of Motion, also known as the law of inertia, states that an object at rest stays at rest and an object in motion stays in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force. This means that objects naturally resist changes to their state of motion. For example, a book sitting on a table will remain there until someone picks it up. Similarly, a hockey puck sliding on ice will continue moving in a straight line at constant speed until friction or another force stops it. Inertia is the tendency of objects to resist changes in their motion, and it is directly related to the object's mass - more massive objects have greater inertia and are harder to accelerate or decelerate.",
    "output": "Newton's First Law (law of inertia) states that objects at rest stay at rest and objects in motion continue moving at constant velocity unless acted upon by an unbalanced force. Inertia is the resistance to changes in motion and increases with mass."

    "input": "The mitochondria is often called the powerhouse of the cell because it is responsible for producing most of the cell's supply of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is used as a source of chemical energy. Mitochondria are double-membraned organelles found in most eukaryotic cells. The outer membrane is smooth, while the inner membrane is folded into structures called cristae, which increase the surface area for ATP production. The space inside the inner membrane is called the matrix. Mitochondria have their own DNA and ribosomes, suggesting they were once independent organisms that were engulfed by early eukaryotic cells in a process called endosymbiosis. The process of cellular respiration occurs in mitochondria, where glucose and oxygen are converted into ATP, carbon dioxide, and water through a series of reactions including glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and the electron transport chain.",
    "output": "Mitochondria are the powerhouse of the cell, producing ATP through cellular respiration. They have a double membrane with cristae (folded inner membrane) and contain their own DNA, supporting the endosymbiotic theory. Cellular respiration in mitochondria converts glucose and oxygen into ATP, CO2, and water through glycolysis, Krebs cycle, and electron transport chain."

    "input": "DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is the hereditary material in humans and almost all other organisms. Nearly every cell in a person's body has the same DNA. The information in DNA is stored as a code made up of four chemical bases: adenine (A), guanine (G), cytosine (C), and thymine (T). Human DNA consists of about 3 billion bases, and more than 99 percent of those bases are the same in all people. The order, or sequence, of these bases determines the information available for building and maintaining an organism. DNA bases pair up with each other, A with T and C with G, to form units called base pairs. Each base is also attached to a sugar molecule and a phosphate molecule, forming a nucleotide. Nucleotides are arranged in two long strands that form a spiral called a double helix. The structure of the double helix is somewhat like a ladder, with the base pairs forming the ladder's rungs and the sugar and phosphate molecules forming the vertical sidepieces.",
    "output": "DNA is the hereditary material storing genetic information in a code of four bases: adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G), and cytosine (C). These bases pair specifically (A-T, C-G) to form base pairs in a double helix structure. Each nucleotide consists of a base, sugar, and phosphate. Human DNA contains ~3 billion base pairs, with the sequence determining genetic information."
