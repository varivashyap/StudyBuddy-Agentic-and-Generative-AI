    "input": "Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants convert sunlight, CO2, and water into glucose and oxygen using chlorophyll in chloroplasts. It consists of two stages: light-dependent reactions (producing ATP and NADPH in thylakoids) and the Calvin cycle (converting CO2 to glucose in the stroma).",
    "output": "[{\"question\": \"What are the products of photosynthesis?\", \"answer\": \"Glucose and oxygen\", \"type\": \"short_answer\"}, {\"question\": \"Where in the chloroplast do light-dependent reactions occur?\", \"answer\": \"In the thylakoid membranes\", \"type\": \"short_answer\"}, {\"question\": \"Which of the following is NOT a requirement for photosynthesis? A) Sunlight B) Carbon dioxide C) Nitrogen D) Water\", \"answer\": \"C) Nitrogen\", \"type\": \"mcq\"}]"
